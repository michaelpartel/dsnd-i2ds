    "The 2019 Survey results have a significant amount of data for the languages a developer is interested in working with. Given the large data set, it would be interesting to see if there is any correlation between those languages and how a developer feels about their career. One may think that certain languages are more pleasant, enriching, or satisfying to work with. From the Udacity Course, we know that developers report higher job satisfaction when they work remotely or when they work for a smaller company. \n",

    "With the Job Satisfaction delta placed in a sorted chart, it appears that while there is a negligible difference in satisfaction between desiring and not desiring a language, there is some level of relevance. As we learned in the linear model, we can't say there is actually a correlation (with rSquared at under 0.005), it is interesting to note that some languages (or more likely the other aspects of jobs that rely on those languages) have some minor impact. Scala, Dart, Erlang, and Objective-C all suggest a negative impact when used at scores deltas of -0.08 to -0.1. Conversely, we can see a smaller positive impact when developers use things like Bash/Shell/PowerShell at +0.1. Many languages (16 of the 27 options) introduce a negative score impact when used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the lack of viable correlation in the model, these small impacts can't be said to truly be related to the languages someone uses. I would hesitate to suggest that using a random language will likely result in an negative impact to your satisfaction, but it does make one wonder: \"what is it about these languages that could cause a change in satisfaction?\""
